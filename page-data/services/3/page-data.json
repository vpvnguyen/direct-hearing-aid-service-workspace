A block (usually consisting of cotton or rubber) is\ninserted into the ear canal (including a removal string), and through\nthe use of a syringe, the prepared material is injected into the canal\nand concha, allowed time to harden, and is then removed.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nThe finished impression is then submitted to an earmold lab which begins\nthe process of manufacturing a shell by making a mold of the impression\nand then casting a plastic replica of the ear. This becomes what is\ncalled the shell of a Custom-Made Hearing Aid.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nThe faceplate is a separate pre-finished plastic part which is then\nbonded to the finished shell. The faceplate, which holds the appropriate\nelectronic components including the battery door, microphone and volume\ncontrol, is not custom-made but is modified and adapted to fit the\ncustom shell.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nThe placement of all switches or buttons on a Faceplate is critical\nsince they have to be operated or activated by the use of a finger and\nit is important that the hearing aid user can find and activate the\nvarious devices by touch. The Replacement of such switches and devices\nis usually accomplished under the Class 1 Electronic Repair Services.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nThe faceplate may also have to be replaced due to Physical Damage or\nAbuse, or from the plastic cracking or otherwise being damaged and\nunserviceable. A damaged faceplate prevents the separating and opening\nof the faceplate from the shell, required in all Servicing of the\nHearing Aid itself.\n</p>\n","tableOfContents":{},"breadcrumbs":[{"name":"Services","path":"/services"},{"name":"Class 3 Hearing Aid Repair","path":"/services/3"}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["311856940","4283962402"],"slicesMap":{}}
